This is the second part of a tutorial about building a McCLIM backend
for the terminal starting from zero. After reading [[https://turtleware.eu/posts/Controlling-the-terminal.html][the first issue]] we
should have a good grasp of how to control and read input from the
terminal. It is time to refine things for efficiency and ease of use.
If you didn't follow the last part, here is the archive with the
[[https://turtleware.eu/static/misc/01-controlling-the-terminal.tar.gz][source code]] which will serve as a starter for this post. If you like
this kind of work, you can [[https://www.patreon.com/jackdaniel_kochmanski][toss a coin to your Lisper]] :-).

Right now our I/O is synchronous with the terminal. When we call ~out~
or ~ctl~, the characters are sent to it immedietely, and we read the
input with ~read-input~ until the stream is empty. The model
introduced in the previous post is certainly simple, but simple models
tend to be hard to use efficiently . We'll settle on _easy_ instead.
In this post I'll focus on the output.

* Layered abstraction

#+BEGIN_QUOTE David Wheeler
All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of
indirection.
#+END_QUOTE

We'll build a convenient abstraction for writing console applications.
It would be a shame though if we had abandoned means to manipulate the
terminal directly. The library will present different APIs, so it is
possible to cater to the programmer demands. In principle it is not
feasible to use two different abstractions simultaneously because
higher abstractions build upon lower ones and things may go awry.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE Unknown
... except for the problem of too many layers of indirection.
#+END_QUOTE

For now we'll define two packages: ~eu.turtleware.charming-clim/ll~
and ~eu.turtleware.charming-clim.terminal/hl~ with low and high level
abstraction for accessing the terminal. They are meant only as means
to export symbols, all implementation is made in a single package.
This practice greatly improves quality of life of person who works
with Common Lisp packages. Now create a file ~packages.lisp~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defpackage #:eu.turtleware.charming-clim/ll
    (:export #:init-terminal
             #:close-terminal
             #:*terminal*

             #:put #:esc #:csi #:sgr
             #:read-input #:keyp

             #:reset-terminal
             #:clear-terminal

             #:clear-line
             #:set-foreground-color
             #:set-background-color

             #:with-cursor-position
             #:set-cursor-position
             #:save-cursor-position
             #:restore-cursor-position
             #:request-cursor-position

             #:cursor-up
             #:cursor-down
             #:cursor-right
             #:cursor-left

             #:set-cursor-visibility
             #:set-mouse-tracking))

  (defpackage #:eu.turtleware.charming-clim/hl
    (:export #:with-console #:out #:ctl))

  (defpackage #:eu.turtleware.charming-clim
    (:use #:common-lisp
          #:eu.turtleware.charming-clim/ll
          #:eu.turtleware.charming-clim/hl))
#+END_SRC

We'll take this opportunity to make function naming more consistent
and introduce functions for cursor manipulation. Rename functions

- ~(setf cursor-visibility)~ -> ~set-cursor-visibility~
- ~(setf mouse-tracking)~    -> ~set-mouse-tracking~
- ~(setf alt-is-meta)~       -> ~set-alt-is-meta~

and add escape sequences for manipulating the cursor. Don't forget to
change references to renamed functions in other parts of the code (in
a macro ~ctl~ and in functions ~initialize-instance~, ~(setf ptr)~ and
~(setf cvp)~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (macrolet ((moveit (endch)
               `(if (= n 1)
                    (csi ,endch)
                    (csi n ,endch))))
    (defun cursor-up    (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "A"))
    (defun cursor-down  (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "B"))
    (defun cursor-right (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "C"))
    (defun cursor-left  (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "D")))

  (defun set-cursor-visibility (visiblep)
    (if visiblep
        (csi "?" 2 5 "h")
        (csi "?" 2 5 "l")))

  ;;; (csi ? tracking ; encoding h/l)
  ;;; tracking: 1000 - normal, 1002 - button, 1003 - all motion
  ;;;           1004 - focus in/out
  ;;; encoding: 1006 - sgr encoding scheme
  (defun set-mouse-tracking (enabledp)
    (if enabledp
        (csi "?" 1003 ";" 1006 "h")
        (csi "?" 1003 "l")))

  (defun set-alt-is-meta (bool)
    (if bool
        (setf +alt-mod+ +meta-mod+)
        (setf +alt-mod+ +alt-mod*+)))
#+END_SRC

From now on when we talk about a low level abstraction we'll call the
destination object the "terminal", while when we talk about high level
abstraction we'll call it the "console". Rename the following symbols

- ~*console-io*~  -> ~*terminal*~
- ~init-console~  -> ~init-terminal~
- ~close-console~ -> ~close-terminal~
- ~clear-console~ -> ~clear-terminal~
- ~reset-console~ -> ~reset-terminal~

and replace all references in the source code to use new symbols. Move
the variable ~*terminal*~ and functions ~init-terminal~ and
~close-terminal~ to the top below the foreign function definitions.

We'll slightly refactor ~set-*-color~ functions. Instead of accepting
each color separately it will consume a number representing the color
RGBA value (each is one byte). For instance #ff000000 for a color red.
The alpha channel will be ignored for now, but having it will save us
another change of a data representation format.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun set-foreground-color (color)
    (let ((r (ldb '(8 . 24) color))
          (g (ldb '(8 . 16) color))
          (b (ldb '(8 .  8) color))
          (a (ldb '(8 .  0) color)))
      (declare (ignore a))
      (sgr "38;2;" r ";" g ";" b)))

  (defun set-background-color (color)
    (let ((r (ldb '(8 . 24) color))
          (g (ldb '(8 . 16) color))
          (b (ldb '(8 .  8) color))
          (a (ldb '(8 .  0) color)))
      (declare (ignore a))
      (sgr "48;2;" r ";" g ";" b)))
#+END_SRC

and fix all references in the source code:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defmacro ctl (&rest operations)
  `((:fgc `(setf (fgc *console*) ,@args))
    (:bgc `(setf (bgc *console*) ,@args)))

(defclass console ()
  (:default-initargs :fgc #xffa0a000 :bgc #x22222200))

(defmethod (setf fgc) :after (rgba (instance console))
  (set-foreground-color rgba))

(defmethod (setf bgc) :after (rgba (instance console))
  (set-background-color rgba))

(defun show-screen ()
  (out (:bgc #x00000000 :fgc #xbb000000))
  (out (:bgc #x00000000
        :fgc (alexandria:random-elt '(#x00444400 #x00444400 #x00664400)))))

#+END_SRC

We'll move now parts related to the console to a separate file
~console.lisp~ in this order:

- the variable ~*console*~ and the macro ~with-console~
- clipping (variables and operators ~inside~ and ~with-clipping~)
- macros ~letf~, ~out~ and ~ctl~
- functions ~clear-rectangle~, ~get-cursor-position~ and
  ~update-console-dimensions~
- the class ~console~ and its methods

Finally the example code will be put in a file ~example.lisp~. Move
there functions ~show-screen~ and ~start-display~.

A ~defsystem~ form in the file ~eu.turtleware.charming-clim.asd~ looks
now like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defsystem "eu.turtleware.charming-clim"
    :defsystem-depends-on (#:cffi)
    :depends-on (#:alexandria #:cffi #:swank)
    :components ((:cfile "raw-mode")
                 (:file "packages")
                 (:file "terminal" :depends-on ("packages"))
                 (:file "console" :depends-on ("packages" "terminal"))
                 (:file "example" :depends-on ("packages" "console"))))
#+END_SRC

* Virtual buffers

Console is responsible for many things, so refactoring it to inherit
from a class which represents only output makes sense. That will be
also useful when we decide to add yet another layer of indirection.
When implementing the ~buffer~ class we'll also fix unfortunate
position representation as a cons and the clip area specification.

Macros ~out~ and ~ctl~ will operate on the current virtual buffer. In
order to do that we will define a protocol which must be implemented
by all virtual buffers. ~with-clipping~ becomes now a convenience
macro expanding to a generic function ~invoke-with-clipping~. A macro
~with-buffer~ is introduce to bind the current buffer, which is bound
to the variable ~*buffer*~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defgeneric put-cell (buffer row col ch fg bg))

  (defgeneric fgc (buffer))
  (defgeneric (setf fgc) (fgc buffer)
    (:argument-precedence-order buffer fgc))

  (defgeneric bgc (buffer))
  (defgeneric (setf bgc) (bgc buffer)
    (:argument-precedence-order buffer bgc))

  (defgeneric row (buffer))
  (defgeneric (setf row) (row buffer)
    (:argument-precedence-order buffer row))

  (defgeneric col (buffer))
  (defgeneric (setf col) (col buffer)
    (:argument-precedence-order buffer col))

  (defgeneric rows (buffer))
  (defgeneric cols (buffer))

  (defgeneric inside-p (buffer row col))
  (defgeneric invoke-with-clipping (buffer continuation
                                    &rest opts
                                    &key r1 c1 r2 c2 fn))

  (defmacro with-clipping ((buffer &rest opts) &body body)
    (let ((fn (gensym)))
      `(flet ((,fn () ,@body))
         (declare (dynamic-extent (function ,fn)))
         (invoke-with-clipping ,buffer (function ,fn) ,@opts))))

  (defvar *buffer*)

  (defmacro with-buffer ((object) &body body)
    `(let ((*buffer* ,object)) ,@body))
#+END_SRC

Implementing ~ctl~ and ~out~ macros function in these terms
follows. We will leave out ~:cvp~ and ~:ptr~ options from the ~ctl~
macro for a time being. ~letf~ and ~clear-rectangle~ are left
unchanged.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defmacro letf (bindings &body body)
    (loop for (place value) in bindings
          for old-val = (gensym)
          collect `(,old-val ,place)      into saves
          collect `(setf ,place ,value)   into store
          collect `(setf ,place ,old-val) into restore
          finally (return `(let (,@saves)
                             (unwind-protect (progn ,@store ,@body)
                               ,@restore)))))

  (defmacro out ((&key row col fgc bgc) object)
    `(let ((buf *buffer*)
           (str (princ-to-string ,object)))
       (assert (null (find #\newline str)))
       (letf (((row buf) (or ,row (row buf)))
              ((col buf) (or ,col (col buf)))
              ((fgc buf) (or ,fgc (fgc buf)))
              ((bgc buf) (or ,bgc (bgc buf))))
         (loop with row = (row buf)
               for col from (col buf)
               for ch across str
               with bgc = (bgc buf)
               with fgc = (fgc buf)
               do (put-cell buf row col ch fgc bgc)))))

  (defmacro ctl (&rest operations)
    `(let ((buf *buffer*))
       ,@(loop for op in operations
               collect (destructuring-bind (name &rest args) op
                         (ecase name
                           (:clr `(clear-rectangle ,@args))
                           (:fgc `(setf (fgc buf) ,@args))
                           (:bgc `(setf (bgc buf) ,@args))
                           (:row `(setf (row buf) ,@args))
                           (:col `(setf (col buf) ,@args)))))))

  (defun clear-rectangle (r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (loop with str = (make-string (1+ (- c2 c1)) :initial-element #\space)
          for r from r1 upto r2
          do (out (:row r :col c1) str)))
#+END_SRC

What would be a protocol without the implementation? Clipping will be
implemented with the class ~clip~. This choice is transparent, because
all functions are specialized on the buffer. Each buffer has its own
clipping region. Abstract buffers don't know how to draw on a screen,
so ~put-cell~ prints a warning.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass bbox ()
    ((r1 :initarg :r1 :accessor r1)
     (c1 :initarg :c1 :accessor c1)
     (r2 :initarg :r2 :accessor r2)
     (c2 :initarg :c2 :accessor c2)))

  (defclass clip (bbox)
    ((fn :initarg :fn :accessor fn))
    (:default-initargs :r1 1 :c1 1 :r2 24 :c2 80
                       :fn (constantly t)))

  (defclass buffer ()
    ((fgc :initarg :fgc :accessor fgc :documentation "Foregorund color")
     (bgc :initarg :bgc :accessor bgc :documentation "Background color")
     (row :initarg :row :accessor row :documentation "Current row")
     (col :initarg :col :accessor col :documentation "Current col")
     (clip :initarg :clip :accessor clip :documentation "Clipping object")
     (rows :initarg :rows :accessor rows :documentation "Buffer number of rows")
     (cols :initarg :cols :accessor cols :documentation "Buffer number of cols"))
    (:default-initargs :clip (make-instance 'clip)))

  (defmethod put-cell ((buffer buffer) row col ch fg bg)
    (warn "put-cell: default method does nothing!"))

  (defmethod inside-p ((buffer buffer) row col)
    (let ((clip (clip buffer)))
      (and (<= (r1 clip) row (r2 clip))
           (<= (c1 clip) col (c2 clip))
           (funcall (fn clip) row col))))

  (defmethod invoke-with-clipping ((buffer buffer) cont &key r1 c1 r2 c2 fn)
    (let ((clip (clip buffer)))
      (letf (((r1 clip) (or r1 (r1 clip)))
             ((c1 clip) (or c1 (c1 clip)))
             ((r2 clip) (or r2 (r2 clip)))
             ((c2 clip) (or c2 (c2 clip)))
             ((fn clip) (if (null fn)
                            (fn clip)
                            (let ((old-fn (fn clip)))
                              (lambda (row col)
                                (and (funcall fn row col)
                                     (funcall old-fn row col)))))))
        (funcall cont))))
#+END_SRC

Finally we can modify the console class itself. ~with-console~ binds
buffer separately, so we have access to different ~*buffer*~ and
~*console*~ at the same time.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defmacro with-console ((&rest args
                           &key ios fgc bgc cvp fps &allow-other-keys)
                          &body body)
    (declare (ignore fgc bgc cvp fps))
    `(let* ((*terminal* ,ios)
            (*console* (make-instance 'console ,@args)))
       (unwind-protect (with-buffer (*console*) ,@body)
         (close-terminal (hnd *console*)))))
#+END_SRC

Updating the console dimensions now involves modifying upper bounds of
the clipping region.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defun update-console-dimensions ()
  (with-cursor-position ((expt 2 16) (expt 2 16))
    (multiple-value-bind (rows cols)
        (get-cursor-position)
      (setf (rows *console*) rows)
      (setf (cols *console*) cols)
      (setf (r2 (clip *console*)) rows)
      (setf (c2 (clip *console*)) cols))))
#+END_SRC

And the class ~console~ itself is remodeled to inherit from the class
~buffer~. Notice that we get rid of slots ~pos~ and ~app~

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass console (buffer)
    ((ios :initarg :ios :accessor ios :documentation "Console I/O stream.")
     (cvp :initarg :cvp :accessor cvp :documentation "Cursor visibility.")
     (ptr :initarg :ptr :accessor ptr :documentation "Pointer tracking.")
     (fps :initarg :fps :accessor fps :documentation "Desired framerate.")
     (hnd               :accessor hnd :documentation "Terminal handler."))
    (:default-initargs :ios (error "I/O stream must be specified.")
                       :fgc #xffa0a000 :bgc #x22222200 :row 1 :col 1
                       :cvp nil :ptr t :fps 10))

  (defmethod initialize-instance :after
      ((instance console) &key fgc bgc row col cvp ptr)
    (setf (hnd instance) (init-terminal))
    (set-foreground-color fgc)
    (set-background-color bgc)
    (set-cursor-position row col)
    (set-cursor-visibility cvp)
    (set-mouse-tracking ptr)
    (let ((*console* instance))
      (update-console-dimensions)))

  (defmethod (setf fgc) :after (rgba (instance console))
    (set-foreground-color rgba))

  (defmethod (setf bgc) :after (rgba (instance console))
    (set-background-color rgba))

  (defmethod (setf row) :after (row (instance console))
    (set-cursor-position row nil))

  (defmethod (setf col) :after (col (instance console))
    (set-cursor-position nil col))

  (defmethod (setf ptr) :after (ptr (instance console))
    (set-mouse-tracking mouse-tracking (not (null ptr))))

  (defmethod (setf cvp) :after (cvp (instance console))
    (set-cursor-visibility (not (null cvp))))
#+END_SRC

Putting a cell on the screen is a matter of setting the cursor
position, cell colors and calling ~put~. It is the responsibility of
~put-cell~ to verify, whether the cell is inside the clipping region.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defmethod put-cell ((buffer console) row col ch fg bg)
    (when (inside-p buffer row col)
      (set-cursor-position row col)
      (set-foreground-color fg)
      (set-background-color bg)
      (put ch)))
#+END_SRC

Finally we need to account for a change in the ~with-clipping~ macro
to pass a buffer as the first argument and remove references to the
~app~ accessor. Modify ~show-screen~:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun show-screen ()
    (loop for ch = (read-input)
          until (null ch)
          do (cond ((keyp ch #\Q :c)
                    (cl-user::quit))
                   ((keyp ch #\U :c)
                    (ignore-errors (user-action)))))
    (flet ((ll (row col)
             (or (and (< (abs (- (+ col row) 26)) 2)
                      (<= col 20))
                 (< (abs (- (+ (- 40 col) row) 26)) 2))))
      (with-clipping (*buffer* :fn #'ll :r1 2 :r2 11)
        (out (:row (1+ (random 12))
              :col (1+ (random 40))
              :bgc #x00000000
              :fgc #xbb000000)
             (alexandria:random-elt '("X" "O"))))
      (with-clipping (*buffer* :fn (lambda (row col)
                                     (or (= row 1)
                                         (= row 12)
                                         (funcall (complement #'ll) row col))))
        (out (:row (1+ (random 12))
              :col (1+ (random 40))
              :bgc #x00000000
              :fgc (alexandria:random-elt '(#x00444400 #x00444400 #x00664400)))
             (alexandria:random-elt '("+" "-"))))))
#+END_SRC

All these changes were pretty invasive, so make sure to restart the
image and try running application once more to validate, that
everything works.

* Writing the example application

Time to write a new example application. Sit tight, we are writing a
window manager! For the sake of being compatible with CLIM terminology
we'll call it a frame manager. Each application will be represented by
a frame defined by its bounding box and a rendering function.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass frame-manager ()
    ((frames :initarg :frames :accessor frames :documentation "All frames")
     (active :initarg :active :accessor active :documentation "Active frame"))
    (:default-initargs :frames nil :active nil))

  ;;; Ha ha, totally not a clip.
  (defclass frame (bbox)
    ((fn :initarg :fn :accessor fn))
    (:default-initargs :r1 1 :c1 1 :r2 24 :c2 80
                       :fn (constantly t)))
#+END_SRC

Displaying the frame involves calling the rendering function with
clipping enabled and showing decorations. Usually cell width is
smaller than its height, so drawing decorations as a vertical bar on
one of the application sides makes more sense if we want to save some
space. That's what we'll do. Active frame will be signified with a

Handling events is now a responsibility of a separate function.
Current key actions:

- C-Q :: quit
- C-R :: update dimensions and redraw the console
- C-N :: change the active frame
- C-U :: call the user action
- C-E :: signal an error

~start-display~ is slightly modified to behave better with errors.

Define two application renderers so we have something to display. Note
that each renderer must know its frame position. In other words
~show-lambda~ as it is currently defined can't be moved as a
frame. Noise demo is like a white noise, but in color.

~show-screen~ starts a loop which is responsible for updating the

performance. At bottom we'll display a modeline printing whichever
information we'll find useful.

It is easy to spot that the modeline flickers. This is because we
first clear the whole line and then we draw on top of it. This is
something that will be addressed soon.


* Extending examples

Let's construct a few examples which will help us to identify some
problems. First move functions ~start-display~, ~show-screen~ and
~user-action~ to a separate file ~examples.lisp~ (don't forget to add
this file to the system definition).

First we'll rework slightly our abstraction. First of all we'll
introduce a frame-manager class which will be responsible for
multiplexing input and output on the screen. It has two slots:

- frames :: a list of managed windows
- active :: the active window

For a time being when there is an active frame, only this frame is
rendered. Otherwise all frames are rendered.

All events will be passed to the function ~handle-event~. We'll bind
few keys initially: C-q will exit the application and C-r will remove
all frames and clear the screen.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass frame-manager ()
    ((frames :initarg :frames :accessor frames :documentation "All frames.")
     (active :initarg :active :accessor active :documentation "Active frame."))
    (:default-initargs :frames nil :active nil))

  (defun handle-event (fm event)
    (flet ((reset ()
             (setf (frames fm) nil
                   (active fm) nil)
             (clear-console)))
      (cond ((keyp event #\Q :c)
             (cl-user::quit))
            ((keyp event #\R :c)
             (reset)))))

  (defun display-screen (fm)
    (alexandria:if-let ((frame (active fm)))
      (render-frame frame)
      (dolist (frame (frames fm))
        (render-frame frame))))

  (defun render-frame (huh?)
    (declare (ignore huh?))
    (error "niy!"))
#+END_SRC

Now let's refactor the function ~start-display~. It will a modeline at
the top and display the terminal dimensions and the frame rate.
Moreover it will create a frame manager and will be responsible for
calling previously defined functions. When we start the application,
we'll see a heart warming message "We are that good!", meaning that we
are too fast to measure the FPS.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun start-display ()
    (swank:create-server)
    (with-console (:ios *terminal-io*)
      (clear-console)
      (loop with rows = (rows *console*)
            with cols = (cols *console*)
            with fm = (make-instance 'frame-manager)
            do (when *console-dirty-p*
                 (update-console-dimensions)
                 (setf rows (rows *console*)
                       cols (cols *console*)))
            do (loop for ch = (read-input)
                     until (null ch)
                     do (handle-event fm ch))
            do (let (start stop delta)
                 (setf start (get-internal-real-time))
                 (display-screen fm)
                 (setf stop (get-internal-real-time))
                 (setf delta (/ (- stop start)
                                internal-time-units-per-second))
                 (ctl (:fgc #x22 #x22 #x22)
                      (:bgc #xbb #xbb #xbb))
                 (let* ((status (format nil "Rows ~3d, Cols ~3d, FPS ~8,2f"
                                        (1- rows) cols (if (zerop delta)
                                                           :|We are that good!|
                                                           (/ 1.0 delta))))
                        (len (length status)))
                   (ctl (:clr 1 (1+ len) 1 cols))
                   (out (:col 1 :row 1) status))
                 (ctl (:fgc #xff #xa0 #xa0)
                      (:bgc #x22 #x22 #x22))))))
#+END_SRC

Now we'll define the class for a frame. A frame will be defined by its
clipping region and a rendering function.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass frame ()
    ((rfn :initarg :rfn :accessor rfn :documentation "Rendering function.")
     (fsz :initarg :fsz :accessor fsz :documentation "Frame dimensions.")))

  (defun render-frame (frame)
    (destructuring-bind (r1 c1 r2 c2) (fsz frame)
      (with-clipping (:row1 r1 :col1 c1 :row2 r2 :col2 c2)
        (funcall (rfn frame) frame))))
#+END_SRC

For amusement and to have something to render, we'll define three
demos to illustrate some issues.

The noise demo is like a white noise, but in color :-). It fills each
cell with a different random color. We will use it as the rendering
performance benchmark and to illustrate how overlapping frames behave.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun make-noise-frame (r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (flet ((make-noise-renderer (color)
             (lambda (frame)
               (destructuring-bind (r1 c1 r2 c2) (fsz frame)
                 (loop for row from r1 upto r2
                       do (loop for col from c1 upto c2
                                do (out (:row row
                                         :col col
                                         :bgc `(0 0 0)
                                         :fgc color)
                                        (alexandria:random-elt '("+" "-")))))))))
      (make-instance 'frame
                     :rfn (make-noise-renderer
                           (list (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))))
                     :fsz (list r1 c1 r2 c2))))
#+END_SRC

The animation demo will show a moving square bouncing from the frame
edges. We will use it to illustrate a flicker which happens when we
first clear the background and then draw it content even when the FPS
rate is high. The animation speed does not depend on the fps.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun make-animation-frame (r1 c1 r2 c2 speed)
    (let ((last-time (get-internal-real-time))
          (dc 1)

          (current-col (+ c1 2)))
      (flet ((draw-square ()

                    (:clr r1 c1 r2 c2))
               (let* ((now (get-internal-real-time))
                      (delta (- now last-time))
                      (seconds (/ delta internal-time-units-per-second)))
                 (incf current-col (* seconds speed dc))
                 (setf last-time now))
               (cond ((>= (+ current-col 2) c2)
                      (setf dc -1))
                     ((<= (- current-col 2) c1)

                     (alexandria:clamp current-col (+ c1 2) (- c2 2)))
               (loop with row = current-row
                     with col = (round current-col)
                     for r from (1- row) upto (1+ row)
                     do (loop for c from (- col 2) upto (+ col 2)
                              do (out (:row r :col c) "#")))))
        (make-instance 'frame

The event demo is a stub for now. Later it will print events passed to
it, for now it prints outside the frame. We will use it to illustrate
a need for scroll bars and for the offset abstraction when the content
goes beyond the frame dimensions and to reveal an interesting bug in
the ~out~ macro.

  (defun make-report-frame (r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (flet ((reporter (frame)
             (declare (ignore frame))

               (loop with rows = (+ (- r2 r1) 3)
                     with col = (- c1 2)
                     for row from (1- r1) upto (1+ r2)
                     for id = (- row r1 -2)
                     for string = (format nil "XXX ~d/~d: ~a" id rows str)
                     do (out (:row row :col col :fgc '(#xff #x88 #x88)) string)))))
      (make-instance 'frame
                     :rfn #'reporter

Finally we'd like to see them on the screen, so we'll bind a few
controls.

- ~C-n~ will create four rather small frames: two overlapping noise
  frames, one animation frame and one event reporting frame
- ~C-m~ will create one maximized noise frame
- ~C-u~ will toggle activation of a random frame

Add the following clauses to cond in ~handle-event~:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

                                     1

#+END_SRC

We also want to have window decorations. On a terminal the space is
limited and each character is precious. That's why we'll draw
decorations only on the right border of the frame. Desired behavior:

- press "x" to close the frame
- press "o" to maximize the frame ("v" to reverse)
- press ">" to minimize the frame ("<" to reverse)
- drag " " to move the frame
- drag "/" to resize the frame
- when the frame output exceeds its size, add scroll bars

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun render-window (frame)
    (destructuring-bind (wr1 wc1 wr2 wc2) (fsz frame)
      (declare (ignore wc1))
      (when (= wr2 (first *row2*))
        (return-from render-window
          (render-frame frame)))
      (ctl (:bgc #x11 #x11 #x11)
           (:fgc #xbb #xbb #xbb))

        (out (:row (+ wr1 2) :col col) ">")
        (loop for row from (+ wr1 3) upto wr2
              do (out (:row row :col col) " "))
        (out (:row (- wr2 0) :col col) "/"))
      (ctl (:bgc #x22 #x22 #x22)

performance benchmark. Now we can move forward to test things.

Looking at our examples we can easily spot a few problems:

- the last two columns are not shown in the event demo
- a small frame rate in the full screen noise demo (~40fps)
- overlapping windows flicker and overexpose their output
- flickering with the background in the animation demo

The first issue is because we have a bug! When we render text in the
event reporter demo, we start from a column which is two characters
before the clipping area beginning. Looking at the macro ~out~ we have
there the following loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (loop for c from col
        for s across str
        when (inside row c)
          do (put s))
#+END_SRC

Increasing the cursor position is an implicit side-effect of calling
put. So when the character does not fit inside the clipping region, we
leave the cursor at its previous position. That's why in fact we start
drawing before the clipping region. We need to advance the cursor
manually. Since we are at it, we will add a few more escape sequences:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (macrolet ((moveit (endch)
               `(if (= n 1)
                    (csi ,endch)
                    (csi n ,endch))))
    (defun cursor-up    (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "A"))
    (defun cursor-down  (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "B"))
    (defun cursor-right (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "C"))
    (defun cursor-left  (&optional (n 1)) (moveit "D")))

  (defmacro out (#|...|#)
    `(let (#|...|#)
       #|...|#
       (loop for c from col
             for s across str
             if (inside row c)
               do (put s)
             else
               do (cursor-right))))
#+END_SRC

* Benchmarking output

When we render the noise demo on the area 80x24 the frame rate is very
unimpressive – around 40 fps. We can't write games like this!  We'll
take a look at the function ~put~ which is responsible for the actual
writing on the terminal. It has a call to ~finish-output~, but we
don't need it to be called after each call. We'll put that at the end
of the rendering loop instead. Don't forget to change
~get-cursor-position~ to do that, otherwise we may get stuck during
startup!

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun put (&rest args)
    "Put raw string on a console"
    (format *console-io* "~{~a~}" args))

  (defun start-display ()
    #|...|#
    (loop #|...|#
          do (finish-output *console-io*)))

  (defun get-cursor-position ()
    (request-cursor-position)
    (finish-output *console-io*) ; <-----
    (handler-case (loop (read-input))
      (cursor-position-report (c)
        (values (row c) (col c)))))
#+END_SRC

Aha, Jackpot! Our rendering is now twice as fast as before with a
staggering 100 frames per second. Let's go one step further and
inhibit all writing to the terminal.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defvar *inhibit* nil)
  (defun put (&rest args)
    "Put raw string on a console"
    (unless *inhibit*
      (format *console-io* "~{~a~}" args)))

  (defun display-screen (fm)
    (let ((*inhibit* t))
      (alexandria:if-let ((frame (active fm)))
        (render-window frame)
        (dolist (frame (frames fm))
          (render-window frame)))))
#+END_SRC

That gives us whooping 500-1000fps on 80x24 window (what is the upper
limit of the measurement which is based on the internal time). Clearly
our rendering is I/O bound at the moment. Notice though, that even now
when we resize the terminal (and recreate the frame) to i.e 158x84
we'll have a frame rate around 111fps, which is not that impressive.
There is certainly merit in optimizing for the CPU time after we fix
the bottleneck with I/O.

We need to write to the console as little as possible. The rest of the
time is spent on looping over cells and doing things like picking a
random color. Ideally we'd write at most one character in each cell,
but we also do other things, like setting the cursor position and
colors. It is time for us to count characters per frame! We can't do
better than 80x24 = 1920 with the noise demo.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defvar *count* nil)
  (defun put (&rest args)
    "Put raw string on a console"
    (let* ((payload (format nil "~{~a~}" args))
           (length (length payload)))
      (when *count*
        (incf *count* length))
      (princ payload *console-io*)
      (finish-output *console-io*)))

  (defun start-display ()
    #| ... |#
    (let (start stop delta count)
      #|...|#
      (let ((*count* 0))
        (display-screen fm)
        (setf count *count*))
      #|...|#
      (out (:col 1 :row rows)
           (format nil "Rows ~3d, Cols ~3d, FPS ~8,2f, chars ~8d"
                   (1- rows) cols (if (zerop delta)
                                      :|We are that good!|
                                      (/ 1.0 delta))
                   count)))
    #| ... |#)
#+END_SRC

Let's remind ourselves what is the current shape of the function
~make-noise-frame~, we'll tinker with it to compare different
approaches:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun make-noise-frame (r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (flet ((make-noise-renderer (color)
             (lambda (frame)
               (destructuring-bind (r1 c1 r2 c2) (fsz frame)
                 (loop for row from r1 upto r2
                       do (loop for col from c1 upto c2
                                do (out (:row row
                                         :col col
                                         :bgc (alexandria:random-elt
                                               `((0 0 0) (8 8 8)))
                                         :fgc color)
                                        (alexandria:random-elt '("+" "-")))))))))
      (make-instance 'frame
                     :rfn (make-noise-renderer
                           (list (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))))
                     :fsz (list r1 c1 r2 c2))))
#+END_SRC

This demo gives us 153267 characters per frame, which compared to 1920
is over 81 times more. Something went terribly wrong! Our prime
suspect is a macro ~out~. Let's put the ~out~ out of the picture.
We'll set the state manually with ~ctl~ and won't bring back the old
one. Also we won't bother we repositioning the cursor after each cell.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun make-noise-frame (r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (flet ((make-noise-renderer (color)
             (lambda (frame)
               (ctl (:pos r1 . c1)) ; <- set the render beginning
               (destructuring-bind (r1 c1 r2 c2) (fsz frame)
                 (loop for row from r1 upto r2
                       do (loop for col from c1 upto c2
                                do (let ((fg color)
                                         (bg (alexandria:random-elt `((0 0 0) (8 8 8)))))
                                     (ctl (:fgc (first fg) (second fg) (third fg))
                                          (:bgc (first bg) (second bg) (third bg))))
                                   (put (alexandria:random-elt '("+" "-")))))))))
      (make-instance 'frame
                     :rfn (make-noise-renderer
                           (list (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))))
                     :fsz (list r1 c1 r2 c2))))
#+END_SRC

That gives us 59526 characters per frame what is almost thrice as
fast. Now let's try skipping setting the color whatsoever.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun make-noise-frame (r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (flet ((make-noise-renderer (color)
             (lambda (frame)
               (ctl (:pos r1 . c1)) ; <- set the render beginning
               (destructuring-bind (r1 c1 r2 c2) (fsz frame)
                 (loop for row from r1 upto r2
                       do (loop for col from c1 upto c2
                                do (put (alexandria:random-elt '("+" "-")))))))))
      (make-instance 'frame
                     :rfn (make-noise-renderer
                           (list (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))
                                 (alexandria:random-elt '(#x22 #x88 #xff))))
                     :fsz (list r1 c1 r2 c2))))
#+END_SRC

Aha, 1926 characters! Setting the cursor position accounts for the
remaining 6 characters ~ESC [ 2 ; 1 H~. So truly the macro ~out~ is
our culprit.

Here is a short comparison of these approaches. ~out~ brings back the
old state, ~ctl+put~ sets the color for each cell but doesn't restore
the old state, and ~put~ sets the position only once and writes to
consecutive cells (no color). Numbers are ~fps / chars-per-frame~. The
throughput of my terminal is roughly 10M characters per second.

| col;row | out           | ctl+put      | put          |
|---------+---------------+--------------+--------------|
|   80x24 | 100 / 154664  | 250 / 61446  | 500+ / 1926  |
|   80x80 | 19  / 517040  | 77  / 211206 | 500+ / 6406  |
|  159x86 | 8   / 1097034 | 14  / 423900 | 333  / 13680 |
|  319x86 | 5   / 2210304 | 10  / 877894 | 166  / 27440 |

These numbers may differ in case of examples with colors, because they
are selected randomly, and printing ~255;255;255~ consumes obviously
more characters than i.e ~42;42;42~. Also note, that this is the worst
case scenario where we change colors for each cell of both background
and foreground. Usually numbers should be much more favorable to us.

#+CAPTION: Noise demo variants
#+NAME:   fig:noise
[[./static/02-noise-demo.webm]]

As we can see, a major bottlenecks are:
- bringing back the old state of a medium
- repositioning the cursor for output
- changing foreground and background color

Sometimes changing color is not necessary, because it does not change
from cell to cell. For instance in the noise demo the foreground color
doesn't change and only the background color is picked randomly.

* Virtual console

We've already introduced the class ~console~ which is a layer of
indirection for a terminal access. We will extend this concept into
something resembling a display server. Time to introduce a few terms:

- terminal :: an actual terminal area
- vconsole :: a virtual screen area
- surface  :: a rectangular area on a vconsole
- vbuffer  :: an object which may be mapped onto a surface

The visible output of our display server is the intersection between a
~terminal~ and a ~vconsole~ areas. Separation of the ~vbuffer~ and the
~surface~ is necessary if we consider the output which does not fit in
its window (and requires scroll bars).

~vconsole~ and ~vbuffer~ have the same prefix because they are very
similar – both serve as the intermediary between the operation and the
drawing. That's why they will implement a common protocol made of a
single function ~flush-buffer~ which name is self-explanatory. It
specializes on the first argument and is expected to flush its output
onto a rectangle specified by other arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defgeneric flush-buffer (buffer r1 c1 r2 c2))
#+END_SRC

We'll start with renaming the class ~console~ and removing ~:after~
methods which immediately send the escape sequence when particular
slots are set.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ;; rename the class

  (defclass vconsole () #| ... |#)

  (defmethod initialize-instance :after
      ((instance vconsole) &key fgc bgc pos cvp ptr)
    #| ... |#)

  (defmacro with-console (#|...|#)
    #| ... |# (make-instance 'vconsole ,@args))

  ;; remove methods

  ;; (defmethod (setf fgc) :after (rgb (instance console))
  ;;   (apply #'set-foreground-color rgb))

  ;; (defmethod (setf bgc) :after (rgb (instance console))
  ;;   (apply #'set-background-color rgb))

  ;; (defmethod (setf pos) :before (pos (instance console))
  ;;   (check-type (car pos) (integer 1))
  ;;   (check-type (cdr pos) (integer 1)))

  ;; (defmethod (setf pos) :after (pos (instance console))
  ;;   (set-cursor-position (car pos) (cdr pos)))

  ;; (defmethod (setf ptr) :after (ptr (instance console))
  ;;   (set-mouse-tracking (not (null ptr))))

  ;; (defmethod (setf cvp) :after (cvp (instance console))
  ;;   (set-cursor-visibility (not (null cvp))))
#+END_SRC


Now replace a cumbersome slot ~pos~ with separate slots ~row~ and
~col~. That requires also modifications to the macro ~out~ and
~ctl~. Since we are at it remove also the slot ~app~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass vconsole ()
    (;; (pos ...)
     ;; (app ...)
     (row :initarg :row :accessor row)
     (col :initarg :col :accessor col)
     #| ... |#)
    (:default-initargs ;; :pos '(1 . 1)
                       ;; :app nil
                       :row 1
                       :col 1
                       #| ... |#))

  (defmacro out ((&key row col fgc bgc) object)
    "Put an object on a console"
    `(let ((str (princ-to-string ,object)))
       (assert (null (find #\newline str)))
       (letf (((row *console*) (or ,row (row *console*))
               (col *console*) (or ,col (col *console*)))
              ,@(when fgc `(((fgc *console*) ,fgc)))
              ,@(when bgc `(((bgc *console*) ,bgc))))
         (let ((row (row *console*))
               (col (col *console*)))
           (loop for c from col
                 for s across str
                 if (inside row c)
                   do (put s)
                 else
                   do (cursor-right))))))

  (defmacro ctl (&rest operations)
    `(progn
       ,@(loop for op in operations
               collect (destructuring-bind (name &rest args) op
                         (ecase name
                           (:clr `(clear-rectangle ,@args))
                           (:fgc `(setf (fgc *console*) (list ,@args)))
                           (:bgc `(setf (bgc *console*) (list ,@args)))
                           (:cvp `(setf (cvp *console*) ,@args))
                           (:ptr `(setf (ptr *console*) ,@args))
                           (:row `(setf (row *console*) ,@args))
                           (:col `(setf (col *console*) ,@args)))))))
#+END_SRC

Of course now that we do not set the cursor position on the terminal
anymore (because we've removed ~after~ methods) and output is all
jumbled up. We will add an array to ~vconsole~ which will hold the
output and implement the ~flash-buffer~ method for ~vconsole~. Array
dimensions will be always adjusted when a ~update-console-dimensions~
is called to match the terminal size. Keep in mind, that arrays are
indexed starting from [0,0] and the terminal from [1,1].

Note that we are not paying much attention to minimizing number of
writes yet. We always dump whole array onto the terminal regardless of
whether the region has been damaged or not. We still need to fix
~out~, ~ctl~ and ~clear-rectangle~ operators to write to the array.
Code may be slightly simplified, because we don't need to bind console
slots in ~out~ (so we may get rid of the macro ~letf~). Macro ~ctl~
gains a new option ~fls~ which is responsible for adjusting the array
and flushing the buffer.

Finally we need to update examples. Instead of ~finish-output~ in the
last form of the ~loop~ in ~start-display~ we need to flush the buffer
with the ~ctl~ operator and we need clear the array in ~handle-event~
(instead of clearing the terminal, because array contents will be
redrawn on it anyway in the next iteration).

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defun handle-event (fm event)
  (flet ((reset ()
           #|...|#
           (clear-rectangle 1 1 (rows *console*) (cols *console*))))
    #|...|#))

(defun start-display ()
  #|...|#
  (loop #|...|#
    ;;; do (finish-output *console-io*)
    do (ctl (:fls)))
#+END_SRC

After this step examples should work, although our measurement methods
are giving us wrong results. FPS and character count is measured for
the function ~display-screen~ while part of the time is spent on
flushing the buffer, and all characters are written there. We will
gather information for a whole iteration and print it in the next
header (so printed data describes a previous frame including the top
bar with the information):

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

          for cols = (cols *console*)
          for start = (get-internal-real-time)
          for *count* = 0
          do (loop for ch = (read-input)

                   (setf fps (/ 1.0 delta)))))))
#+END_SRC

Now when we run examples we notice a few important things:

1. Frame rate is constant disregarding of how much we draw

It is roughly similar to the ~put+ctl~ version from our previous
benchmark. The fact that we are slow is because we always write whole
array and we always do set the position and color for the printed
character.

2. There is no flicker between separate drawings

Both overlapping windows and animated square do not flicker anymore,
because all updates are done in the memory, only the final result is
rendered. So we've that problem solved.

3. Console size is updated interactively when we resize the terminal

We've started invoked ~update-console-dimensions~ in order to adjust
the array in the ~(ctl (:fls))~. This is a very nice side effect.

#+CAPTION: Virtual console in action
#+NAME:   fig:vconsole
[[./static/02-vconsole.webm]]

* Optimizing flush-buffer

Our improvements caused that our rendering is smooth. On the other
hand, we always exhibit the worst case scenario regardless of a
damaged area and flush whole array. On top of that each written
character conses a new list. If that's not enough we need to also
note, that we set the cursor position and color even when we don't
have to. This section will try to address these performance issues.

First we'll try to not modify the cursor position and colors in the
function ~flush-buffer~ when it is not necessary. Since the method
specialized on the ~vconsole~ is always called after updating the
console dimensions, we know that text will wrap when it advances from
the last column, so we may set it only once. Regarding colors it is a
matter of tracking whether the cursor color changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defmethod flush-buffer ((buffer vconsole) r1 c1 r2 c2)
    (set-cursor-position r1 c1)
    (loop with data = (data *console*)
          with max-row-index = (1- (min r2 (array-dimension data 0)))
          with max-col-index = (1- (min c2 (array-dimension data 1)))
          for row-index from (1- r1) upto max-row-index
          do (loop with last-fg = nil
                   with last-bg = nil
                   for col-index from (1- c1) upto max-col-index
                   do (let ((cell (aref data row-index col-index)))
                        (destructuring-bind (character
                                             (fg.r fg.g fg.b)
                                             (bg.r bg.g bg.b))
                            cell
                          (unless (equal last-fg (second cell))
                            (set-foreground-color fg.r fg.g fg.b)
                            (setf last-fg (second cell)))
                          (unless (equal last-bg (third cell))
                            (set-background-color bg.r bg.g bg.b)
                            (setf last-bg (third cell)))
                          (put character))))
          finally (finish-output *console-io*)))
#+END_SRC

These changes give us a wonderful improvement. For a terminal of size
80x24 a full screen noise demo number of characters written drops from
80000 down to 15000, and for smaller windows from 85000 down to 7000!
FPS also increases significantly.

* Optimizing the memory use

We will now take a pity on the CPU and the memory. We excessively call
~adjust-array~ and cons a new list for each written character. We'll
have the array contents initialized with instances of ~vcell~. Access
to data buffer will be abstracted away with functions ~get-cell~ and
~set-cell~, so we don't need to care about mismatch between array and
terminal first index elsewhere.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass vcell ()
    ((ch :initarg :ch :accessor ch)
     (fg :initarg :fg :accessor fg)
     (bg :initarg :bg :accessor bg))
    (:default-initargs :ch #\space
                       :fg (fgc *console*)
                       :bg (bgc *console*)))

  (defun get-cell (data row col
                   &aux (i0 (1- row)) (i1 (1- col)))
    (or (aref data i0 i1)
        (setf (aref data i0 i1) (make-instance 'vcell))))

  (defun set-cell (cell ch fg bg)
    (setf (ch cell) ch
          (fg cell) fg
          (bg cell) bg))
#+END_SRC

When the array is too small to hold the screen we'll resize it, when
the screen is smaller than the array we'll leave it be.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun update-console-dimensions ()
    (with-cursor-position ((expt 2 16) (expt 2 16))
      (multiple-value-bind (rows cols)
          (get-cursor-position)
        (setf (rows *console*) rows)
        (setf (cols *console*) cols)
        (destructuring-bind (ar ac) (array-dimensions (data *console*))
          (when (or (> rows ar) (> cols ac))
            (adjust-array (data *console*)
                          (list rows cols)
                          :initial-element nil)))
        (setf *row2* (list rows))
        (setf *col2* (list cols)))))
#+END_SRC

Finally we'll use new operators in operators ~out~, ~clear-rectangle~
and ~flush-buffer~:

* Optimizing number of writes

In many applications it is the case that only small portion of the
screen changes between frames. Redrawing each character on the console
in ~flash-buffer~ is necessary for the full screen noise demo, but
that isn't a typical case. Since we are I/O bound we'll try to reduce
number of writes to the terminal by tracing "dirty" cells and
redrawing only when necessary. We can do that thanks to the function
~set-cell~.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass vcell ()
    ((ch :initarg :ch :accessor ch)
     (fg :initarg :fg :accessor fg)
     (bg :initarg :bg :accessor bg)
     (dirty-p :initarg :dirty-p :accessor dirty-p))
    (:default-initargs :ch #\space
                       :fg (fgc *console*)
                       :bg (bgc *console*)
                       :dirty-p t))

  (defun set-cell (cell ch fg bg)
    (unless (and (char= (ch cell) ch)
                 (= (fg cell) fg)
                 (= (bg cell) bg))
      (setf (ch cell) ch
            (fg cell) fg
            (bg cell) bg
            (dirty-p cell) t)))
#+END_SRC


Writing the cell will be also abstracted with a function ~put-cell~
which will mark the cell as "clean". Current color will be stored in
the variable ~*console*~ which may be accessed dynamically. When
~flush-buffer~ exits, the old colors are restored. When the cell is
not "dirty" the flush loop will skip. When next "dirty" character
appears we need to reposition the cursor.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun put-cell (cell)
    (let ((ch (ch cell))
          (bg (bg cell))

        (set-foreground-color fg)
        (setf (fgc *console*) fg))
      (unless (eql (bgc *console*) bg)
        (set-background-color bg)
        (setf (bgc *console*) bg))
      (put ch)

Thanks to this change number of characters written in a demo with
multiple windows drops from 8000 to 2000-3000. Improvement for a full
screen noise demo is negligible.

Now our console is more fragile when it comes to resizes and writes
from somewhere else. Since we do not redraw cells unknown artifacts
are not refreshed. Resize may be mitigated in when updating the
console dimensions by forcing a full refresh. We will also change
slightly the interface of ~flush-buffer~. ~update-console-dimensions~
returns now ~t~ when dimensions change (~nil~ otherwise).

* Virtual buffers

To prepare for upcoming changes we'll do a refactor. ~vconsole~ will
be broken into ~vbuffer~ superclass responsible for the output and
~vconsole~ representing the terminal. Current output sink will be
designated by a special variable ~*buffer*~.

Cell manipulation is abstracted with a small protocol specialized on
the buffer. Internal representation of a cell is expected to be known
by the ~flush-buffer~ implementer.

- (get-cell buffer row col) :: returns a specified cell
- (put-cell buffer row col) :: flushes a specified cell
- (set-cell buffer row col) :: changes a specified cell

~with-clipping~ will be remodeled to accept the buffer as the first
argument. Instead of operating on dynamic bindings we'll encapsulate
the clipping object in an instance of a class ~vclip~. This is pretty
inflexible now, but reworking ~with-clipping~ to have underlying
~invoke-with-clipping~ generic function called with a continuation
instead would be trivial. We just don't need that for now. We'll put
the virtual buffer implementation in a file ~vbuffers.lisp~.

We keep the variable ~*console*~ separate from a variable ~*buffer*~
in case of a need to access the terminal (and not "the current"
buffer). ~get-cursor-position~ is the cause of the input processing
flakiness - it consumes events which it doesn't recognize - we'll
tackle this problem in the next part of the tutorial. When the
terminal dimensions change, we force a full repaint of the buffer to
avoid corruption due to line wrap.

* Surfaces

We've introduced the concept of a virtual buffer so now we may
implement a surface. Surface is a window in a screen into the frame.

# Initially I've thought about implementing it with conformally
# displaced arrays, but I've decided that it would be too much hassle
# without much gain (given that they are not first class citizen in
# Common Lisp implementations). I've written [[https://turtleware.eu/posts/Conformal-array-displacement.html][a separate post]] about them.

We'll add a new file to the project called "surfaces.lisp", it depends
on ~packages~ and on ~vbuffers~. It is a dependency of ~examples~.

The idea is to have applications render to their own private buffer,
which in turn is flushed to its parent. Implementing it will enable us
to render a static window once and update only damaged parts when
necessary. Moreover we want to be able to move and scroll frames.

Given the above description surface is an intersection of the screen
buffer and the frame buffer. The frame is displaced onto the console
between coordinates [r1,c1; r2,c2] with additional offset [row0;col0]
to allow scrolling. All we need to do now is to specialize functions
~put-cell~ and ~flush-buffer~ to copy cells between buffers at fixed

To scroll a buffer we need to put some constraints. We don't want to
scroll beyond the frame edges, because then the intersection between
buffers would be an empty region. We need to account for two cases
(for each axis):

1. The surface is bigger than the frame buffer.

   In this case we have some "empty" area between the buffer end and
   the surface edge. Scrolling then is not necessary, because all
   output is visible. That said we may want to scroll the content in
   the surface area, so we are going to implement that. Alternative
   solution would be for instance to fix its position at the top left
   corner of a surface. Buffer should have its edges inside the
   surface area.

2. The surface is smaller than the frame buffer.

   This case is quite straightforward - not all output is visible, so
   we need to scroll to see it. Surprisingly the constraint for buffer
   edges is almost symmetrical to the first case. The first edge of a
   buffer is smaller or equal to the surface first edge, and the
   second edge of a buffer is bigger or equal to the surface second
   edge. That assures that we have no unnecessary empty space.

This logic is implemented in the following two functions:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun move-to-row (buf row0)
    (let* ((rows (rows buf))
           (height (1+ (- (r2 buf) (r1 buf))))
           (vrow1 (- 1    row0))
           (vrow2 (- rows row0)))
      (when (if (> height rows)
                (and (<= 1 vrow1 height)
                     (<= 1 vrow2 height))
                (and (<= vrow1 1)
                     (>= vrow2 height)))
        (setf (row0 buf) row0))))

  (defun move-to-col (buf col0)
    (let* ((cols (cols buf))
           (width (1+ (- (c2 buf) (c1 buf))))
           (vcol1 (- 1    col0))
           (vcol2 (- cols col0)))
      (when (if (> width cols)
                (and (<= 1 vcol1 width)
                     (<= 1 vcol2 width))
                (and (<= vcol1 1)
                     (>= vcol2 width)))
        (setf (col0 buf) col0))))

Scrolling is usually made in some quantities. That's how we'll model
the function ~scroll-buffer~. If the scroll quantity goes beyond the
possible value, then it will be scrolled to the maximum at that
direction.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defun scroll-buffer (buf row-dx col-dx)
    (flet ((quantity (screen-size buffer-size dx)
             (if (alexandria:xor (> screen-size buffer-size)
                                 (minusp dx))
                 0
                 (- buffer-size screen-size))))
      (unless (zerop row-dx)
        (let ((height (1+ (- (r2 buf) (r1 buf)))))
          (or (move-to-row buf (+ (row0 buf) row-dx))
              (setf (row0 buf)
                    (quantity height (rows buf) row-dx)))))
      (unless (zerop col-dx)
        (let ((width (1+ (- (c2 buf) (c1 buf)))))
          (or (move-to-col buf (+ (col0 buf) col-dx))
              (setf (col0 buf)
                    (quantity width (cols buf) col-dx)))))))
#+END_SRC

Like me, you may have problems with thinking about the scrolling
direction. There are two strategies which make sense

- following the cursor
- move the window

If the former is interpretation is taken, then "scrolling down" moves
the window up, because we want to have the cursor visible. That
behavior is usually associated with arrow keys and scroll bars in
applications. The latter interpretation seems to be more natural when
you grab the content and move the pointer.

* Reworking examples

A frame will now be a subclass of a surface. Thanks to that we will be
able to "draw" starting from the row and col being [1;1] and it will
be up to the ~put-cell~ to translate the position. Each frame has its
own buffer now which needs to be flushed after completion.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defclass frame (surface)
    ((rfn :initarg :rfn :accessor rfn :documentation "Rendering function."))
    (:default-initargs :vbuf *console*))

  (defun fsz (frame)
    (values (r1 frame) (c1 frame) (r2 frame) (c2 frame)))

  (defun render-frame (frame)
    (with-buffer (frame)
      (funcall (rfn frame) frame)
      (ctl (:fls))))

  (defun render-window (frame)
    (multiple-value-bind (wr1 wc1 wr2 wc2) (fsz frame)
      (ctl (:bgc #x111111)
           (:fgc #xbbbbbb))
      (clear-rectangle wr1 wc1 wr2 (1+ wc2))
      (let ((col (1+ wc2)))
        (out (:row wr1 :col col :fgc #xff2244) "x")
        (out (:row (+ wr1 1) :col col) "o")
        (out (:row (+ wr1 2) :col col) ">")
        (out (:row (- wr2 0) :col col) "/"))
      (render-frame frame)))

Constructors also change. Most notably drawing starts from
[1,1]. Additionally ~make-report-frame~ accepts fifth argument saying
how many lines should the demo have. We'll use that to illustrate
scrolling.

Now we'll improve the active window selection. ~C-u~ circulates the
active window and decorations change color to distinguish it. To
deselect windows press ~C-i~. Moreover we'll add key bindings to
scroll buffers.
